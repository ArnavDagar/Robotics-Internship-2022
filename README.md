# Robotics-Internship-2022
Included PID Control on Encoder Motors, Servo Motors, Forward and Inverse Kinematics. Internship with Mr. Eric Busboom in the summer of 2022

## 1. Controlling servo motors

## 2. Using stepper motor drivers to control stepper motors

### a). Using a POT to control speed and direction

## 3. Handling interrupts on Arduino



## 4. **PID Contoller for DC Motor with Encoder** 


The goal of the project was to implement a PID Controller for a DC Motor using an Arduino, a motor driver. I tested its performance by verifying how the speed of the motor tracked a square wave and a pot human control.

All of the code is contained in the Arduino Sketch: 

### a). DC Motor

* Using an H-Bridge to power the motor
* Using the Encoder to read the speed and direction of the motor
* Using a POT input or a sign wave input to control the speed of the motor with a PID controller

## 5. 2D Forward and Inverse Kinematics
### a). Animation of Forward Kinematics in Python and Octave
### b). Inverse Kinematics using a lookup dictionary created in Forward Kinematics

## 6. X-Y Plotter - work in progress. I have the physical frame ready

## 7. Finding the location of a robot using a camera - this is a work in progress
