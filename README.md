Included PID Control on Encoder Motors, Servo Motors, Forward and Inverse Kinematics. Internship with Mr. Eric Busboom in the summer of 2022

# **PID Contoller for DC Motor with Encoder** 


The goal of the project was to implement a PID Controller for a DC Motor using an Arduino, a motor driver. I tested its performance by verifying how the speed of the motor tracked a square wave and a pot human control.

All of the code is contained in the Arduino Sketch:
